# How to use the `!players` command<br />

## Modo and above
`!players init` to init the bot. To do when you launch the game.<br />
`!players update` to update the amount of players in your game if you did the new game too soon.<br />
`!players reset` to reset (i don't remember what but maybe that was useful for me :) )<br /><br />
If the bot didn't wrote `"New game"` at the drop (after the selecting a spawn screen) : <br />
`!players newGame` (or `!players ng`) to calculate how many players there is in your game. To do on the drop screen! So that you're sure that the game loaded everyone.<br />

Do not modified and share without asking me<br />
Do not download scripts of people you don't know and trust, that's easy to do a malware with that.<br />
If you have any issue just contact me (I may not respond that depends of my mood)<br />
